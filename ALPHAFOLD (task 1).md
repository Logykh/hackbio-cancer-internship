# **AlphaFold Protein Structure Database: A Basic Introduction**

The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB, https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) has significantly improved protein structure prediction. Proteins are vital biological molecules made up of amino acids, and their functions are tightly related to their three-dimensional shapes. Understanding protein structures is critical for learning about their functions and roles in biological processes. AlphaFold's ability to reliably anticipate these structures can transform structural bioinformatics and our understanding of protein function (1).

DeepMind developed AlphaFold, a neural network that accurately predicts protein structures. It uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to handle complex structures and combines bioinformatics and physical concepts. AlphaFold can predict the structure of proteins with atomic precision, even when no homologous structures are known, filling critical gaps in structural biology (1).

**Architecture and Evaluation Metrics of AlphaFold**

AlphaFold uses an Evoformer block to predict 3D structures by refining a residue gas model, ensuring precise side-chain interactions, and examining intermediate structures generated by each block (1). AlphaFold's accuracy is measured using metrics such as backbone RMSD and TM-score, and it performs well on recent PDB structures. The model's fast prediction capabilities enable large-scale structural biology applications (1). AlphaFold excels in predicting structures for homomers and proteins with extensive intra-chain contacts, but it performs less well for proteins that rely on heterotypic connections, especially in bigger complexes (1).

# **Database Expansion**

The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, launched in November 2021, now comprises over 214 million predicted protein structures, a huge increase from the first 300,000 structures provided in 2021\. The AlphaFold2 artificial intelligence system permitted this extension. Furthermore, the predicted structures have been incorporated into various major databases, increasing their usability and influence in structural biology and related domains (3).

# **Conclusion**

The AlphaFold Database is a significant development in protein structure prediction, providing a comprehensive and freely available database for high-accuracy protein structures created using AlphaFold v2.0. It helps study many biological domains by providing numerous data access mechanisms, including bulk downloads, API access, and interactive visualization. Aiming to bridge the gap between known protein sequences and experimentally informed structures, thereby promoting biomolecular research worldwide (2). The AlphaFold Database enhances structural biology by providing millions of predicted protein structures, impacting various life sciences domains and improving accessibility through its incorporation into core data resources (3).
